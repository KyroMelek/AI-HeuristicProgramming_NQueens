# AI-HeuristicProgramming_NQueens
This project solves the N-Queens puzzle, attempting to place N queens in an N x N grid such that no queen lies in an attack path of another queen. This implementation allows for the placing of a queen as an initial condition and attempts to place N-1 additional queens, if possible. This approach uses the backtracking search algorithim.
